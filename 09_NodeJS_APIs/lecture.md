What do we mean by consuming an API?
	- Third part who tells us everything!
		- how much to get the data - utilize end points
		- how much data we can get
		- what kind of data
		- type of data we are going to get = JSON, or something else



Endpoint is based off of two things
	- Base URL
	- Route

just becasue you see quotes around your key does not mean its json


json is just a string not an object


there is a method that turns objects into JSON
	JSON.stringify()

JSON is a gaint string that we can parse into an object

Other languages can read JSON because all languages use strings in some shape and form



Project 1 tid bits
//res.render('index.js', {rate, symbol})

// let country = req.query.country
//query - submitting something until the user define the input
//params - 

//let rate = data.bpi[country].rate
//let symbol = date.bpi[country].rate


//define the rate and symbol using the data from the object

////{render:"", symbole:""}
