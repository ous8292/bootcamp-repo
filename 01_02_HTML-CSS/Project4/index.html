    <p>
        Hi there veryone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am proud owner of a cat named <b>garfield</b> and a dog name <b>Odie</b>. Garfield is fat, lazy, and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Althoughb my pet drives me crazy, I can't imagine life without them.

        I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizza, and lots and lots of lasanga. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I brought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy more food. <i>I wasn't to happy about that.</i>
