Hi!

A little about me:

I am German, who immigrated to the states at the age of 5. My family is still located in Frankfurt area, Northern Germany, and Southern Germany.

My hobbies include rock climbing, Ju Jitsu, Judo, Muy Thai, surfing, and play video games on my pc!

I am excited to watch this repository grow along with my knowledge.

See you on the other side!
